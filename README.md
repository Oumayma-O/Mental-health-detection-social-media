# Mental-health-detection-social-media
Our project aimed to detect mental health disorders (depression, anxiety, ADHD, and BPD) through social media using Reddit data. We developed a multi-class classifier and employed a one-vs-rest approach, fine-tuning advanced models like BERT and RoBERTa, which outperformed traditional models.
